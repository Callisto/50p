      <p class="regular-prose">50p is a conference that aims to familiarise people with the whats and hows of the online payment ecosystem in India. Who are the players in the landscape? What are the risks associated with online payment gateways and wallets? Are non-cash transactions really secure? What regulations and policies to companies creating payment gateway products need to be aware of?  How do you bridge the gap between developers and businesses in the field?  What are the various SLAs that need to be navigated around? What was the effect of demonetization on the Indian economy?</p>
      <p class="regular-prose">There are three tracks for the conference: identity and fraud, how payment systems work, how cash works.</p>
