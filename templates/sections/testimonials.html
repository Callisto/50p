        <p class="secondary space-one-top nospace-bottom"><i class="fa fa-quote-left pad-half-right"></i>Between refreshing new lessons, business leads, potential hires and the sheer energy of the talent present at the conference, I think it was money & time well spent, even for an early stage startup as ours. We sent 11 members of our team including interns, and I'd do it all over again without thinking twice! This is the standard of discourse we should try and maintain across any conference or event we organize, these guys at HasGeek have a thing or two to teach the rest of our tech ecosystem.</p>

        <p class="secondary space-one-top nospace-bottom"><i class="fa fa-quote-left pad-half-right"></i>The logistics of the conference itself - wifi, videos, communication etc is as good as it gets. Kudos to your guys for running such a high quality data conference overall.</p>

        <p class="secondary space-one-top nospace-bottom"><i class="fa fa-quote-left pad-half-right"></i>Droidcon was a great experience, with so many developers to learn from and meet. Conferences like these give you so many perspectives to look at. The most awaited part for me at the Droidcon was the Women In Tech panel discussion. We need to get more women talking about the challenges they face and how they overcome it. Women can relate and overcome their challenges with that kind of inspiration. About the men, they need to listen too. We need men to lean in for women to stand out at what they do. The conference had the Child care facility. You need to be very sensitive to think of something that is so important to parents attending the conference.</p>
