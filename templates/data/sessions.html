      , 'blurb'       : '<p>In August 2016, Gartner <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/gartner-blockchain-hits-hype-cycle-peak/" target="_blank" class="orange">reported</a> that "Blockchain" has reached the peak of its hype cycle.</p><p>This "Peak" is actually known as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle" target="_blank" class="orange">Peak of Inflated Expectations</a>". If the <a href="http://img.influencing.com.au/misc/007/954/723/o.gif" target="_blank" class="orange">Hype Cycle</a> is a thing to be believed, then it\'s about to hit the "Trough of disillusionment" pretty soon. The astute with a keen interest to work and exploit the technology will educate themselves a bit before the crowd hits the "slope of enlightenment".</p><p>This workshop is for those who want to hit the "slope of enlightenment", to understand the core algorithm behind the blockchain. It is NOT, as lore would have it, anything to do with "Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008. Instead, we need to look further back in history, to July, 1982, when the brilliant computer scientist, Leslie Lamport presented the problem of designing "Reliable Computer Systems", in an abstract fashion. He presented this problem as "<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf" target="_blank" class="orange">The Byzantine Generals Problem</a>".</p><p>In this workshop, we look at "The Byzantine Generals Problem", understand the solution presented, and apply this solution to the Blockchain. This workshop is “hands on” and you’ll be able to use a programming language and an environment of your choice to implement the solution. The expected outcome at the end of this workshop, is that the problem solution would have been demonstrated in code, which may then be applied at participants\' leisure, in any future blockchain related technology.</p><p><h3>Prerequisites:</h3></p><p>Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of algebra, and fluency in at least one computer programming language. No specific domain knowledge is assumed. A healthy curiosity and willingness to question, as well as a logical mindset would be excellent.</p><p><h3>Equipment:</h3></p><p>A useable computer with a programming language development environment of the participant\'s choice will be required.</p><p><h3>Duration: 8 hours</h3></p>'
