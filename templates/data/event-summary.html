People\'s phones haven\'t replaced their wallets, but big money\'s being wagered on that happening within the next few years.</p><p>You\'d still have to navigate a maze of regulations, and at least one SLA.</p>',

It pays to have a good understanding of how it all works before committing to a new technology, product, or partner.</p><p>That\'s why HasGeek is organizing a new conference on the payments landscape, aiming to bridge the gap between developers and business, merchants and consumers, and banks and regulators. Come, learn and share.</p>',

We sent 11 members of our team including interns, and I\'d do it all over again without thinking twice! This is the standard of discourse we should try and maintain across any conference or event we organize, these guys at HasGeek have a thing or two to teach the rest of our tech ecosystem.</p>',

The most awaited part for me at the Droidcon was the Women In Tech panel discussion. We need to get more women talking about the challenges they face and how they overcome it.The conference had the Child care facility. You need to be very sensitive to think of something that is so important to parents attending the conference.</p>',
